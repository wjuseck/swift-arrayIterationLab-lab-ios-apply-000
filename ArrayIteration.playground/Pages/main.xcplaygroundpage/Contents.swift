/*: question1
 ### 1. You're building an app and want to store all of the ingredients added to a cart into an `Array`. The ingredients are "Chips", "Salsa", "Guacamole", and "Red wine". Name this `Array` variable whatever you like, think of a name which makes sense.
 */

var ingredients = ["Chips", "Salsa", "Guacamole", "Red Wine"]




/*: question2
 ### 2. You need to create a list that contains the numbers from 1 to 10. How would you represent this list in code?
 */
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]




/*: question3
 ### 3. Take the list of numbers you created in question 2 and print their values in the most efficient way possible. (Hint: for-in loop).
 */
for number in numbers {
    
    print(number)
    
}







/*: question4
 ### 4. Take the list of shopping cart items you created in question 1 and iterate through it printing each item to the console.
 */
for ingredient in ingredients {
    
    print(ingredient)
    
}






/*: question5
 ### 5. Create a function that takes an array of names and greets each person with the following message "Good morning x" <- x being the individuals name. One caveat. If the persons first name is Michael, we want to greet them with the message, "Top of the morning Michael!".
 */
func greet(names: [String]) {

            print("Good morning \(name).")
        }
        
    }
    
}





/*: question6
 ### 6. Create a function that takes an array of Ints and returns an array of Ints. This function should look through the array of Ints and create a new array of Ints that only contain integers less than 50.
 */
func lessThan50(numbers: [Int]) -> [Int] {

            result.append(number)
